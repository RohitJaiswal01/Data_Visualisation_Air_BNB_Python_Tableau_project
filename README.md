# Data_Visualisation_Air_BNB_Python_Tableau_project
In the context of Airbnb operations, how can the utilization of Python, Tableau Prep, Tableau facilitate a comprehensive comparative examination between Chicago and New Orleans. 

This inquiry seeks to leverage Tableau's visual analytics capabilities to uncover and illustrate the shared attributes, disparities, and distinctive patterns inherent to Airbnb's presence in these cities, thus elevating the depth and insightfulness of the study.


For this EDA project, we have chosen the "Airbnb Listings Data" dataset from 2 major cities: Chicago and New Orleans. This dataset provides a comprehensive snapshot of various attributes related to Airbnb listings, such as property type, neighbourhood, pricing, availability, and more. The dataset is ideal for conducting an in-depth exploration of the local Airbnb market and deriving actionable insights.

# How we have proceeded with the dashboard:

## Data Cleaning

Begin by addressing the disorder and inconsistency within the dataset. Utilise Jupyter Notebook and Tableau Prep to systematically cleanse the data, rectifying discrepancies, eliminating duplicates, and standardising formats.

## Data Transformation

Generate supplementary columns by utilising pre-existing categorical data. These columns will be derived from extensive descriptive text, which, in its original form, proved arduous to comprehend and unsuitable for visualisation purposes. The extra columns that we created gave a much clear sense of how to approach and make an effective visualisation.

## Tableau

Employ Tableau Prep to leverage its distinctive "Group and Replace" feature. Under the column denoted as Neighbourhood there are instances where identical entities are variably represented due to disparities in letter casing, spelling variations, or phonetic similarity. The "Group and Replace" algorithm inherent to Tableau Prep proved instrumental in mitigating this issue.


# Divided the visualisation findings into 4 categories:

## Property analysis



## Pricing analysis



## Host analysis


## Overview of Airbnb
